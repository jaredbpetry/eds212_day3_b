### Make Some Vectors
```{r}
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow")
#----class of object was stored as characters... can't have one vector with different classes within
#----how to check class: 
class(marmots)
```

```{r}
pika <- c(12.4, 5.6, 7.8, 4.9, 6.9)
class(pika)

#---- Scalar multiplier 
scalar_pika <- 5.2*pika
scalar_pika
```

```{r}
bananas <- c(1, 2, 3)
#----add some spaces to make things easier to look at
apples <- c(6, 7, 8)

#----adding and subtracting vectors
bananas + apples 
bananas-apples

#----dot product
bananas %*% apples 
```
